#### MDG-v2 updates

This project will serve as a test to showcase software development improvements from March 2024 - June 2025 (15 month Review).

Additionally, it is to further improve familiarity with regards to the ReactNative upgrade process.

The project is being developed purely on Windows 11 OS for android devices. Future support for the Apple ecosystem is the goal upon purchase of a PERSONAL macOS device.
